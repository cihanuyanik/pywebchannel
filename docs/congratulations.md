# Congratulations!!! ‚úåÔ∏èüéàüéä

You've successfully linked your Python backend to the frontend, introducing a tool capable of dynamically generating
TypeScript interfaces by monitoring backend changes. This tool ensures that your frontend remains synchronized with
backend updates, streamlining the development process.

As long as the tool is active, it automatically updates scripts as you modify the backend, maintaining consistency
between the two worlds. Now, you can explore additional examples and delve into the self-explanatory API.

Consider the following steps as you continue to enhance your development process:

1. Documentation and Usage Guidelines:

- Develop comprehensive documentation to guide users on effectively utilizing the tool.
- Provide clear instructions on structuring the backend code to optimize the automatic generation of TypeScript
  interfaces.

2. Expand Script Generation:

- Explore opportunities to extend the tool's capabilities beyond TypeScript interfaces, such as generating API
  documentation or other relevant artifacts based on backend modifications.

3. User Interface for the Tool:

- Enhance accessibility by creating a user interface for the tool, catering to developers who may prefer graphical
  interfaces over command-line tools.
- Implement features like configurable options and settings to further customize the tool's behavior.
